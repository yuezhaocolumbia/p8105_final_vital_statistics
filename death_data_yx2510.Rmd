The generated dataset consists of `r nrow(my_tidy_data)` observations  and `r ncol(my_tidy_data)` columns. Each observation records information on population and death statistics in one of `r n_distinct(my_tidy_data$cd_name)` community districts in New York City. Variables in the original dataset include sex, age, ethnicity and cause of death and their cross variable with each other. Since we are interested in cause of death in this project, we only kept cause of death and its cross information with other demographic variables. Noteworthily, the presence of a large proportion of NAs could be an issue in later steps.

Cause of death is denoted with c1 to c22, which represent Deaths due to:
1. septicemia,
2. HIV, 
3. malignant neoplasms (cancer),
4. cancer of the colon, rectum, and anus,
5. cancer of the pancreas, 
6. trachea, bronchus, and lung, 
7. cancer of the breast (female), 
8. cancer of the prostate, 
9. diabetes mellitus, 
10. use of or poisoning by psychoactive substance excluding alcohol and tobacco,
11. Alzheimer's disease, 
12. diseases of the heart,
13. essential hypertension and hypertensive renal disease,
14. cerebrovascular diseases, 
15. influenza and pneumonia,
16. chronic lower respiratory diseases, 
17. chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, 
18. Nephritis, Nephrotic Syndrome and Nephrosis, 
19. accident except drug poisoning, 
20. intentional self‐harm (suicide), 
21. assault (homicide), respectively. 
22. others

Race/ethnicity is denoted with 1 to 5, standing for: 
1. Hispanic, 
2. Asian Non‐Hispanic, 
3. White Non‐Hispanic, 
4. Black Non‐Hispanic,
5. others
