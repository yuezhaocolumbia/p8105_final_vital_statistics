The generated dataset consists of `r nrow(my_tidy_data)` observations  and `r ncol(my_tidy_data)` columns. Each observation records information on population and death statistics in one of `r n_distinct(my_tidy_data$cd_name)` community districts in New York City. Variables in the original dataset include sex, age, ethnicity and cause of death and their cross variable with each other. Since we are interested in cause of death in this project, we only kept cause of death and its cross information with other demographic variables. Noteworthily, the presence of a large proportion of NAs could be an issue in later steps.

Cause of death is denoted with c1 to c22, which represent Deaths due to:
1. septicemia,
2. HIV, 
3. malignant neoplasms (cancer),
4. cancer of the colon, rectum, and anus,
5. cancer of the pancreas, 
6. trachea, bronchus, and lung, 
7. cancer of the breast (female), 
8. cancer of the prostate, 
9. diabetes mellitus, 
10. use of or poisoning by psychoactive substance excluding alcohol and tobacco,
11. Alzheimer's disease, 
12. diseases of the heart,
13. essential hypertension and hypertensive renal disease,
14. cerebrovascular diseases, 
15. influenza and pneumonia,
16. chronic lower respiratory diseases, 
17. chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, 
18. Nephritis, Nephrotic Syndrome and Nephrosis, 
19. accident except drug poisoning, 
20. intentional self‐harm (suicide), 
21. assault (homicide), respectively. 
22. others

Race/ethnicity is denoted with 1 to 5, standing for: 
1. Hispanic, 
3. Asian Non‐Hispanic, 
4. White Non‐Hispanic, 
5. Black Non‐Hispanic,


# 2. tidy the data

#### 2.0 dealing with the missing value

```{r}
missing_value = 
  my_tidy_data %>% 
  summarise_all(funs(sum(is.na(.)))) %>% 
  gather(term, num_na, everything()) %>% 
  mutate(percent = num_na/nrow(my_tidy_data)) %>% 
  filter(percent > 0.2) 


```
We filtered those variables with more than 20% of missing value and found `nrow(missing_value)` fell into this category. However, it is quite reasonable that no people from a certain age or gender group died of a certain disease in a specific year and neighbourhood and thus resulted in absence of recording. Missing data could suggest 0 death and removing them will lead to loss of valuable information. Therefore, we kept those missing value in our dataset.

#### 2.1 dataset without demographic characteristics
```{r split our dataset into several subsets}
# we are first dealing with death infomation without accounting for other demographic characteristics
total_death_data = my_tidy_data %>%
  select(cd_number:year, x1: x22, population, total) %>%
  gather(key = "cause_of_death", value = number, x1:x22) 


```

## 2.2 cause of death crossed with gender
```{r}
# cause of death crossed with gender
gender_death_data = my_tidy_data %>%
   select(cd_number : year, c1male :c22female) %>%
   gather (key = "cause_of_death", value = "number", c1male : c22female)   

# split "death cause/gender" into gender
  gender_death_data = gender_death_data %>% 
   mutate(gender = ifelse(str_detect(gender_death_data$cause_of_death, "female"), "female", "male"))

  #split "death cause/gender" into cause of death
gender_death_data =gender_death_data %>%
 mutate(cause_of_death = 
       substr(gender_death_data$cause_of_death,1,str_locate(gender_death_data$cause_of_death, "[0-9][a-zA-Z]")[,1])
 )  

# aggregate cd-level data into borough-level
gender_death_data2 = gender_death_data %>%
  group_by(borough, year, gender, cause_of_death) %>%
  summarise(number_cs_boro_gdr = sum(number, na.rm = TRUE))
  


  
```



## 2.3 dataset crossed with age
```{r}
# cause of death crossed with age 
# gather the age and death info 
age_death_data = my_tidy_data %>% 
select(cd_number: year, c1age_1_12months:c22age_85) %>%
  gather (key = "cause_of_death", value = "number", c1age_1_12months : c22age_85) 

# split the comb variable into age and cause of death
age_death_data = age_death_data %>% 
  mutate(
    age_group = 
      substr(age_death_data$cause_of_death, str_locate(age_death_data$cause_of_death, "age")[,1] + 4, nchar(age_death_data$cause_of_death))
    ) %>%
  mutate(cause_of_death =  
           substr(age_death_data$cause_of_death, 0, (str_locate(age_death_data$cause_of_death, "age")[,1] -1)))  


# aggregate cd-wise number into borough-wise
age_death_data2 = age_death_data %>%
  group_by(borough, year, age_group, cause_of_death) %>%
  summarise(borough_age_death = sum(number, na.rm = TRUE))

# aggregate age groups
age_death_data3 = age_death_data2 %>%
  ungroup %>%
  mutate(age_group = case_when(
    !(age_group  %in% c("1_12months", "28days", "65_69", "70_74", "75_79", "80_84", "85")) ~ "Premature Death",
    age_group %in% c("65_69", "70_74", "75_79", "80_84", "85") ~ ">65 age death",
    age_group == "28days" ~ "new born death",
    age_group == "1_12months" ~ "1_12months death"
  ) )


```


## 2.4 dataset crossed with race
```{r}

# cause of death crossed with race 
race_death_data = my_tidy_data %>%
   select(cd_number:year, c11:c225) %>%
     gather (key = "cause_of_death", value = "number", c11:c225) 

race_death_data = race_death_data %>%
  mutate(race = stri_sub(race_death_data$cause_of_death, -1)) %>%
  mutate(
    cause_of_death = 
      substr(cause_of_death, start = 1, stop = nchar(race_death_data$cause_of_death)-1)
                  ) 

# aggregate cd-wise number into borough-wise
race_death_data2 = race_death_data %>%
  group_by(borough, year, race, cause_of_death )%>%
  summarise(borough_race_death = sum(number, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Now I added specific cause of death to the dataset.
