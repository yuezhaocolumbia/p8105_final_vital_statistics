cd_data =  map_df(name, read_sas)  %>%

pop_data2 = cbind(cd_number2, pop_data2) %>%
  select(borough, cd_number2, cd_name, x2000_population, x2010_population) %>%
  rename("cd_number" = "cd_number2")
  # standardize the cd_number

  


  
# merge the two datasets
my_data = merge(pop_data2, cd_data, by = "cd_number") 
 
my_tidy_data = my_data %>% # we'll use 2000 year population data for 2000 - 2009, and 2010 year data for 2010 -2014 
  mutate(population = ifelse(year < 2010, my_data$x2000_population, my_data$x2010_population)) %>%

The generated dataset consists of `r nrow(my_tidy_data)` observations  and `r ncol(my_tidy_data)` columns. Each observation records information on population and death statistics in one of `r n_distinct(my_tidy_data$cd_name)` community districts in New York City. Variables in the original dataset include sex, age, ethnicity and cause of death and their cross variable with each other. Since we are interested in cause of death in this project, we only kept cause of death and its cross information with other demographic variables. 

Cause of death is denoted with c1 to c22, which represent Deaths due to septicemia, Deaths due to HIV, Deaths due to malignant neoplasms (cancer), Deaths due to cancer of the colon, rectum, and anus, Deaths due to cancer of the pancreas, Deaths due to trachea, bronchus, and lung, Deaths due to cancer of the breast (female), Deaths due to cancer of the prostate, Deaths due to diabetes mellitus, Deaths due to use of or poisoning by psychoactive substance excluding alcohol and tobacco, Deaths due to Alzheimer's disease, Deaths due to diseases of the heart, Deaths due to essential hypertension and hypertensive renal disease, Deaths due to cerebrovascular diseases, Deaths due to influenza and pneumonia, Deaths due to chronic lower respiratory diseases, Deaths due to chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, Deaths due to Nephritis, Nephrotic Syndrome and Nephrosis, Deaths due to accident except drug poisoning, Deaths due to intentional self‐harm (suicide), Deaths due to assault (homicide), respectively. 


# 2. tidy the data
### 2.1 dealting with missing value
```{r}
missing_value = 
  my_tidy_data %>% 
  summarise_all(funs(sum(is.na(.)))) %>% 
  gather(term, num_na, everything()) %>% 
  mutate(percent = num_na/nrow(my_tidy_data)) %>% 
  filter(percent > 0.2) 
```

We filtered those variables with more than 20% of missing value and found `nrow(missing_value)` fell into this category. However, it is quite reasonable that no people from a certain age or gender group died of a certain disease in a specific year and neighbourhood and thus resulted in absence of recording. Missing data could suggest 0 death and removing them will lead to loss of valuable information. Therefore, we kept those missing value in our dataset.

### 2.2 split the dataset into several subsets
#### dataset without demographic characteristcs
```{r}
# we are first dealing with death infomation without accounting for other demographic characteristics

    age_group == "28days" ~ "new born death",

  ) )
```

```

We can see that the mortality rate were higher on average in Bronx and Brooklyn. Besides, all the three community districts in Staten Island had high mortality rate, which could be due to a higher proportion of aged population. The boroughs with highest mortality were Coney Island in Brooklyn and Riverdale in Bronx. Average death rates were lowest in Battery park, followed by Elmuhurst in Quees. The areas with more wealthy people like Manhattan and Queens have a relative low mortality rate overall.

Geographically speaking, the map shows a very interesting pattern that the far north and the far south part of New York are having the highest mortality rates. The middle part of New York is having a lower mortality rate. This is conincident with New York income level where people live in the middle part usually have a higher income while neighbourhood in Staten Island share a high proportion of aged people.

In this plot, caused of death was ordered by the cause specific mortality rate across New York City rather than each borough. We can see that the disease of the heart was the leading cause of deaths in all areas followed by malignant neoplasms as the second leading cause of mortality in each neighbourhood. Heart disease-related mortality rate was particularly high in Staten Island while death rate by HIV and diabetes mellites is particularly high in Bronx. Queens, which holds a higher proportion of Asians, was feature with high colon cancer risk.  Overall, in terms of Cause of Deaths distribution across areas, we do not see a big difference in the structure of the cause of deaths.

From a longitudinal perspective, the mortality rate went down as the years go by. The mortality rate for Brooklyn, Manhattan and Bronx were clustered together in terms of years. Staten Island had a higher mortality rate overall and Queens had the lowest mortality rate. There was a drop in mortality rates between 2006 and 2007. In 2010, there was a second drop in mortality rates.

Heart disease and malignant neoplasms (cancer) were by far the most leading cause of death in our selected years. The leading cause of death basicly remained unchanged from 2032 to 2014 with a only a change in the 10th place where hypertension is replaced by cancer of breast. HIV dropped out from the top ten while breast cancer emerged as new major causes.

Although heart diseas and malignant neoplasms remained the most two major cause of death in two gender, male and female showed very different patern in cause of death. Breast cancer, obviously, was specific to women while prostate cancer was specific to men. We can see that breast cancer ranked the 6th leading cause of female death, however, the risk was diluted in the whole population. Lower respiratory disease was more of a risk than male compared to female, which could be expained by a larger proportion of smoking population in male. Beside, HIV was a greater issue for male and cancer of colon was unique in top ten causes for female.

The number of deaths for female was overall greater than the number of deaths for male. The curves for the two groups were parallel to each other over time. We assume there is some difference between men and women in terms of the number of deaths but the difference was not due to the change of time. One possible explanation was age-population was disproportionately high in femal group since female usually has longer life expectancy.

Different race has similar cause of death pattern with heart disease and malignant neoplasms ranked as the leading two causes of death. HIV only appeared in the Hispanic and the Black group while breast cancer is a leading cause in the White only. Accident except poisoning was ranked as 10th fro Asians and Hispanics but not in the leading cause list for the other two group.

The plotted 15 years witnessed a dramatic drop in tems of death number in the White while this statistics kept stable in the Black and Hispanic. A slight rise can be observed in the Asia group, however, this could be confounded by a rapid increase in Asian population. Since a drop in the White death number was conincident with a dropped in HIV related death, and meanwhile HIV remained one of those leading caused in the Hispanic and Black, we assumed that the decrease in the White death was partly due to decrease in HIV-caused death.

The cause of deaths in the more-than-65-year-old group was very different from that in the premature deaths group. Chronic diseas such as heart disease and hypertension a greater risk in aged people while higher proportion of premature death was due to homicide, psychoactive substance and HIV.
