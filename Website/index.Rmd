#  **Motivation**

Vital statistics including birth and mortality data is of critical importance in assesssing community health status. Birth rate, leading cause of death and mortality rate often serve as cornerstone in formulating public health policies. 

Motality data, for example, offers a snapshot of current health problems and knowing the causes of death, especially the avoidable and treatable ones, helps us to establish intervention for better outcomes. By investigating the trend of a specific cause of death over time, we can also identify consistent risk in a specific groups and evaluate the effect of a certain public health policy. Disparity in mortality rate, premature death and cause of death in different race and gender can indicate socioeconomic inequility.

Birth data, on the other hand,a

For our final Data Science project, we decided to analyze the Medicare data to try to assess some of these claims. 

#  **Data Sources**

*  


* The Best Hospitals Honor Roll is a list of the top 20 hospitals that had the highest ratings across all 16 Best Hospital specialties, nine procedures, and condition ratings. Total points for hospitals on the Best Hospital Honor Roll list are out of a maximum of 448. We scraped the 
[2016-2017 Best Hospitals Honor Roll](https://web.archive.org/web/20160816171510/http://health.usnews.com/health-care/best-hospitals/articles/best-hospitals-honor-roll-and-overview) from the web using CSS selectors. 

More information about the US News & World Reports methodology for the 2016-2017 rankings can be found [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20160910084826/http://static.usnews.com:80/documents/health/best-hospitals/BH_Methodology_2016-17.pdf).   

# **Analyses**

Please see our [video](https://youtu.be/xTQKZP_36tE) for an narrated screencast of our analysis. 

Questions we were interested in included:

* What was the geographic distribution of mortality rate? 

The plots that address these questions can be found [here](https://carolinadownie.shinyapps.io/p8105_finalproject_shiny/). 

* How did the distribution of ratings vary by hospital ownership type? 

* Were there important differences in the Top 20 Hospitals in 2016-2017 as ranked by [US News and World Reports](https://web.archive.org/web/20160816171510/http://health.usnews.com/health-care/best-hospitals/articles/best-hospitals-honor-roll-and-overview) and the corresponding 2016 Medicare scores for these hospitals (i.e. were the hospitals' complaints justified)? 

The plots that adress these questions can be found [here](Hospital_flexdashboard.html). 

* Can we make a logistic model for patient satisfaction score based on other known hospital ranking criteria? 

The preliminary model we created can be found [here](Model_Page.html). 


# **Conclusions and Future Directions**

Our analysis suggests that some of the criticisms of the Medicare Hospital Star rating system may be valid. There was an unexpected geographical distribution of 5-star hospitals (for example, there were more 5 star hospitals in South Dakota than in New York). However, the comparison of the Medicare Hospital rankings and the US News & Reports rankings were more similar than we initially thought they might be, based on the controversy over the Medicare stars. 

Future analyses could include: assessing the Medicare hospital ratings in the context of the socioeconomic demographics of the patients they serve, seeing how these ratings change over time, and more rigorous statistical analyses.
